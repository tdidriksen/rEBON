    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p> BON is the Business Object Notation, a clear and concise graphical
    and textual specification language for software[<a
    href="#WaldenNerson95">WaldenNerson95</a>].  BON is unique in that
    every construct specified in BON is checkable and reversible.  That is
    to say, we can consistently and completely check the conformance of a
    piece of software according to a BON specification and any changes to
    the software can be reflected back into the specification.  The
    specification is obviously an abstraction of the software, but a
    bijection (equivalence relation) exists between the specification an a
    subset of the software it specifies. </p>

    <p> BON is useful for much more than "business" objects --- don't let
    the name fool you.  BON is easy to learn, has a <a
    href="BON_grammar.html">grammar</a> and style that are influenced by
    the Eiffel programming language, and doesn't require a math degree,
    dozens of immense tomes to explain, nor multi-thousand dollar pieces of
    software to use. </p>

    <p> This document describes a suite of tools called "Extended BON" or
    "Extended BON", the core of which is a Extended BON scanner, parser,
    documentation generator, and design model checker.  This set of tools
    is meant to help software developers keep their documentation, design,
    and implementation in sync as well as help find and correct errors as
    early as possible in the process of creating software artifacts. </p>

    <p> Extended BON is an extension of BON by Joseph Kiniry that
    incorporates additional formal specification from [<a
    href="#KiniryZimmerman97">KiniryZimmerman97</a>] and [<a
    href="#Kiniry01">Kiniry01</a>] via the use of <em>semantic
    properties</em> [<a href="#Kiniry02-SP">Kiniry02-SP</a>] into the BON
    standard.  Since Extended BON is a proper superset of BON, this suite
    of tools will work with BON or Extended BON specifications. </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p> The Extended BON tool suite consists of the following tools: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> A <span class="italic">Extended BON parser</span> that reads
        textual Extended BON and generates a faithful, in-memory
        representation of its content.  We call this representation the
        Extended BON Meta Object Graph, or MOG for short. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">serializer</span> that can read and write
        Extended BON MOGs to and from permanent storage. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">documentation generator</span> that can
        convert an MOG into a set of documents in a variety of formats
        according to a "pluggable" set of rules. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">MOG differencing tool</span> that can
        determine the minimal rewrites necessary to convert from a source
        MOG to a target MOG. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">EBON2Eiffel tool</span> that
        generates Eiffel skeleton code from a Extended BON
        specification. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">EBON<->Eiffel refinement mapping
          tool</span> that helps a user map a specification to code. </li>
      <li> A <span class="italic">Extended BON Eiffel design model
          checker</span> that compares an Eiffel implementation against a
        Extended BON specification. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p> The phrase "<span class="bold">must</span>" means that the design
    and implementation of the discussed component is not considered
    completely unless the indicated capability is present and correct.  The
    phrase "may" means that the capability is optional; it is a secondary
    requirement. </p>

    <p> The Extended BON parser <span class="bold">must</span>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> parse the full BON textual specification language and represent
        specifications written in this language unambiguously, </li>

      <li> parse the full Extended BON textual specification language and
        represent specifications written in this language unambiguously,
      </li>

      <li> flag syntax and usage errors in a clear, concise, and correct
        fashion, </li>

      <li> include and parse a Extended BON specification of itself. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The Extended BON parser may: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> cache parse trees between invocations, </li>

      <li> detect and parse only those documents which have changed since the
        last parse, </li>

      <li> Support redefinition of string delimiters (String_begin and
        String_end). </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The Extended BON serializer <span class="bold">must</span>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> serialize and unserialize an in-memory representation to a
        time-efficient format, </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The Extended BON serializer may: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> serialize and unserialize in a space-efficient format. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> All tools <span class="bold">must</span>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> compile correctly in the SmallEiffel and ISE compilers. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> All tools may: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> compilation in Object Tools's Visual Eiffel compiler and ISS
        (Halstenbach) compiler. </li>
    </ul>

      <dd> an extension of the BON specification language.  Extended

        Extended BON specification and an Eiffel implementation. </dd>

      <dt> Eiffel </dt>
      <dd> an object-oriented programming language created by Bertrand Meyer
        and supported by four major compilers: GNU SmallEiffel, ISE Eiffel,
        Object Tools Visual Eiffel, and Halstenbach Eiffel. </dd>

      <dt> Isomorphism </dt>

        bijection, a generalized homomorphism. </dd>

      <dt> Lexer </dt>
      <dd> a software component that reads a formal notation and breaks input
        up into distinct, indentified tokens for parsing. </dd>

      <dt> MOG </dt>
      <dd> a Meta Object Graph; a set of data structures used to represent

        metalevel. </dd>

      <dt> Parser </dt>
      <dd> a software tool that converts a tokenized input into a data
        structure-based representation, typically either an abstract symbol
        table (AST) or a metaobject-based data structure like our MOG. </dd>

      <dt> Semantic Property </dt>

      <dd> domain-specific specification constructs used to augment an
        existing language with richer semantics. </dd>

      <dt> Token </dt>
      <dd> a basic construct of lexing and parsing that represents a
        fundamental atom, or idea, and typically one which has a textual or
        graphical representation that is more complex than that which the
        token itself has. </dd>

    <h2>Scheduling Goal</h2>

    <p> This project was started with the intent of entering it into Eiffel
      Struggle 2001.  Only the first three tools (parser, serializer, and
      documentation generator) are meant to be designed and written for
      this contest.  Since the Stuggle did not happen for 2001, we will
      enter this tool into the next contest. </p>
