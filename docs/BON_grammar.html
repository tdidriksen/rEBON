      APPENDIX A: BON textual grammar (from BON text and included for easy
      reference).

      A.1 INTRODUCTION

      This appendix presents a formal syntax specification of the BON
      textual notation, which is useful for automatic processing and for
      maintenance of BON designs where no case tool is available. The
      specification gives a comprehensive overview of all notational
      concepts in BON, facilitating the construction of parsers for
      translating BON charts and diagrams into other desired formats.

      Communicating BON designs from either case tools or text files to
      other tools with well-defined interfaces is thus
      straightforward. Interesting possibilities in this respect include
      configuration management tools, commercial DBMS environments, and
      widely available document processors and desktop publishing
      tools. For example, it is not very difficult to create templates for
      the informal BON charts, using some of the more advanced word
      processors. With textual BON it is then possible to mix the
      interactive input of charts with automatic generation from
      information stored elsewhere.

      The formal description also gives the reader a second chance to
      resolve possible unclarities that always lurk in natural language
      descriptions. Nothing can compensate for the precision of a formal
      notation when it comes to communicating the difficult cases
      unambiguously.

      On the other hand, a language grammar is much harder to read to get a
      general overview of a notation than are typical examples of language
      usage. For this reason, and since a fair portion of the BON textual
      notation has not been shown elsewhere in the book, the next appendix
      will provide the interested reader with textual equivalents to some
      of the graphical BON diagrams presented earlier.

      The textual version of BON does not include any means for describing
      the layout of diagrams. This would require an independent set of
      concepts largely orthogonal to the BON structural elements. Such a
      language may emerge later as a result of experience with case tools
      supporting BON.

      A.2 THE SYNTAX NOTATION

      We will present the BON textual grammar in an extended BNF (Backus
      Naur Form), where the extensions are very close to the ones used in
      [Meyer 1992a]. The syntax notation is based on the following
      concepts.

      Any syntactically meaningful part of a BON textual specification,
      such as a cluster, a class, or an assertion, is called a
      component. The structure of all components of a certain category is
      described by a construct, and an individual component conforming to
      this description is called a specimen of the construct.

      Each construct has a unique construct name, which is a single word in
      roman font starting with a capital letter. For example, Class_chart,
      Feature_clause, and Object_group are construct names, and the
      corresponding specimens are any individual class chart, feature
      clause, etc., that may be built according to the rules specified by
      the grammar.

      Every construct is either terminal or non-terminal. A specimen of a
      terminal construct is called a lexical element or a token. The set of
      tokens make up the basic vocabulary which may be used to construct
      sentences in the language, and their internal structure is not
      described by the grammar. The set of tokens are either considered
      known a priori, or else described separately (usually through regular
      expressions applied to sequences of individual characters, or by
      informal language).

      Non-terminals, on the other hand, are described in terms of other
      constructs, either terminal or non-terminal. Such a description is
      called a production for the construct, and has the following form:

      Construct =   right-hand-side 

      By convention, every non-terminal construct appears (through its
      construct name) as the left-hand side of exactly one
      production. Terminal constructs, on the other hand, may only appear
      on the right-hand side (by definition).  The symbol = means "is
      defined as".

      The right-hand side of a production specifies the structure of the
      left-hand construct, and since every non-terminal construct has a
      production attached, the corresponding specimen can always be
      recursively decomposed into sequences of tokens.

      It is not always possible to tell whether a construct is terminal or
      non-terminal without checking if it occurs as the left-hand side of a
      production or not. However, two common token types are written using
      different typography for easy identification: keywords (in lower case
      boldface) and fixed operators (enclosed in double quotes). There are
      three basic types of production, which have the following forms.

      Aggregate 

      Defines the construct as a fixed sequence of construct parts. One or
      more elements in the sequence may be marked as optional by enclosing
      them in square brackets. For example:

      Parenthesized =   "(" Expression ")" 
      Inheritance_relation =   Child inherit [ "{" Multiplicity "}" ] 
      Parent [ Semantic_label ] 

      defines Parenthesized as a left parenthesis followed by an Expression
      followed by a right parenthesis, and Inheritance_relation as a Child
      construct followed by the keyword inherit, then an optional
      multiplicity part (Multiplicity enclosed in braces), then a Parent
      construct, then an optional Semantic_label.

      Choice 

      Defines the construct as one of a fixed number of alternative
      constructs. It is written as a non-empty sequence of constructs
      separated by vertical bar. The production

      Expression =   Quantification | Call | Operator_expression | Constant 

      therefore means that an Expression is a Quantification, or a Call, or
      an Operator_expression, or a Constant.

      Repetition 

      Defines the construct as a variable length sequence of specimens of
      another construct, possibly separated (if more than one element) by a
      given separator. The separator (if any) may be either terminal or
      non-terminal. A repetition right-hand side is written in one of the
      two forms below:

      { Element_construct Separator_construct ...} 
      { Element_construct Separator_construct ...} + 

      The first form signals that the sequence may be empty, while the
      second requires at least one element. Omitting the separator
      construct means that multiple elements are concatenated without
      separators in this type of sequence. Below are some examples. The
      first production defines an Index_list as a sequence of one or more
      Index_clause, separated by a semicolon. The second defines

      Features as a sequence of one or more Feature_clause without any
      separator. The third production defines a Dynamic_ref as zero or more
      Group_prefix followed by a Dynamic_component_name.

      Index_list =   { Index_clause ";" ...} + 
      Features =   { Feature_clause ...} + 
      Dynamic_ref =   { Group_prefix ...} Dynamic_component_name 

      With these preliminaries, we are now ready to give the full syntax
      specification of the BON textual notation. The grammar is defined in
      the following sections and then concluded by a discussion of the
      lexical components, summing up the keywords and operators used.

      A.10 LEXICAL COMPONENTS 

      We conclude this chapter with a discussion of the lexical components,
      which are used to form BON textual descriptions in accordance with
      the grammar defined in the preceding sections. These components are
      the terminal constructs that do not appear as the left-hand side of
      any production in the grammar, and therefore need to be described
      separately.

      Identifiers 

      The Identifier construct is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric
      characters including underscore. An identifier must begin with an
      alphanumeric character and must not end with an underscore (whose
      purpose really is to mimic word separation). Letter case is not
      significant, but using consistent style rules is important.

      The recommended BON standard is to use all upper case names for class
      and cluster names, all lower case for feature names, and lower case
      beginning with a capital for object groups and constants values. We
      also strongly recommend using underscore for word separation rather
      than, for example, in-word capitalization, since this greatly
      enhances readability.

      Free operators 

      The Free_operator construct represents feature names used as infix
      and prefix operations. Such operations may be textual keywords, such
      as the boolean "and" and "or", but are more often composed of special
      characters, like "+", "**", "=>", etc.

      The purpose is usually to make object-oriented expressions (which are
      always feature calls in the end) look very similar to the formalisms
      used in some discipline thus providing a more compact and readable
      notation for the problem at hand. Since it is difficult to foresee
      exactly what operator combinations may be needed, BON only defines
      the Free_operator construct as a sequence of non-spacing printable
      characters that does not conflict with any of the predefined
      ones. However, in practice, more restrictions are added by each
      development environment.

      Comments 

      Major analysis and design elements, such as static diagrams,
      clusters, classes, object groups, etc., often need to have comments
      attached to them in order to explain overall modeling aspects that
      have no natural place among the constituent parts at lower levels.

      Therefore, the BON textual notation recognizes comments to major
      specification elements as part of the grammar, thereby encouraging
      the standard placement of them. This also provides a parser with the
      possibility to check and possibly enforce certain strategic
      descriptions. However, besides the places recognized by the grammar,
      comments may be inserted anywhere in a BON textual description,
      except inside strings.

      Strings 

      The construct Simple_string is defined as any string of characters
      not containing a New_line character. The non-terminal construct
      Manifest_string is a Simple_string enclosed in the pair of terminals
      String_begin and String_end. Similarly, the non-terminal
      Manifest_textblock is a sequence of Simple_string separated by
      New_line and enclosed by the same pair of terminal constructs (see
      the grammar above).

      These delimiters are defined by default as a string containing one
      double quote character. The character sequence "show some class,
      don't treat me like an object" is then interpreted as a
      Manifest_string. However, to facilitate the accommodation of double
      quotes inside strings without having to insert escape characters, the
      delimiting strings may be changed (often to some control characters
      in connection with automatic processing).

      BON also defines a lexical Concatenator construct. If a Concatenator
      is found inside a Simple_string, it is removed along with all
      characters (including New_line) up to and including the next
      Concatenator construct. This makes it possible to embed formatting
      white space into strings for readability, without making the
      formatting characters part of the strings.

      The Concatenator construct is defined as a single backslash by
      default, but may be changed by the user. It must not conflict with
      the string delimiters. An example of its use is shown below.

      "This is a long simple string, which has been broken into\ 
      \ two lines for readability"

      The basic constructs Integer, New_line, Character, and Real are not
      further specified, since they may need different definitions
      depending on the development environment.

      Reserved words 

      Reserved words are terminal constructs which are predefined sequences
      of letters only, and which cannot be used as identifiers by the user,
      since this might lead to language ambiguities. The reserved words in
      BON consist of keywords and predefined names. There are only three of
      the latter type: Current, Result,and Void. The full list is shown in
      figure A.1.

      Figure A.1 BON reserved words

      and            Current         feature        object       root 
      calls          deferred        for_all        object_group scenario

      cluster        dynamic_diagram inherit        outgoing     such_that 
      cluster_chart  effective       interfaced     part         system_chart 
      command        end             invariant      persistent   true 
      component      ensure          involves       prefix       Void 
      concatenator   event           it_holds       query        xor 
      constraint     event_chart     keyword_prefix redefined 
      creates        exists          member_of      require 
      creation_chart explanation     nameless       Result

      In a sizable language, there is always the risk that some keywords
      steal valuable name space from the user, and textual BON, being
      fairly expressive, is no exception. To counter this disadvantage, BON
      defines a terminal construct Keyword_prefix, which is empty by
      default.

      By defining Keyword_prefix as the string "$", for example, we may
      change the syntax of BON so all keywords now need to be prefixed by a
      dollar sign, thus freeing all the corresponding normal words for use
      in specification of the system under development.

      Special symbols 

      Finally, we collect the complete set of special symbols used in BON
      with an overview of their meaning (figure A.2). Each of them has been
      described earlier in the book. The ones marked as operators (except
      for the type operator ":") can be viewed as class features of infix
      form that may be redefined by descendant classes.

      Conclusion 

      The BON textual notation is a full specification language for
      object-oriented system designs, whose purpose is threefold:

      o It can be used to communicate exact specifications between various
      tools and environments, thus taking advantage of the advances in many
      independent areas of presentation. "

      o It can be used for better understanding of the concepts underlying
      the graphical notation and for settling ambiguities. With today s
      widely available parser generator utilities, the task of writing a
      parser for the language becomes easy. "

      o It provides a means of storing and updating a specification in a
      simple way, using standard text editors, which can serve as an
      alternative to a dedicated case tool. It may be feasible to copy
      small whiteboard diagrams with pencil on paper in connection with
      design sessions, but maintaining larger specifications requires
      more. Anybody who has experienced the pain of trying to keep evolving
      graphical figures up to date without strong automatic support knows
      only too well what we are talking about.

      Finally, regarding the different presentations that may be generated
      from a BON textual description, we have not tried to cover graphical
      layout in the textual language. The basic graphical appearance of
      each textual concept has been defined earlier in this book, along
      with validity constraints and rules for how relational arrows may be
      combined, labels be positioned, etc. But what valid alternative to
      choose is left to the strategies of the individual case tool.

    <h2 align="center">Grammar notes, modifications, etc.</h2>

    <p> We note the various problems, corrections, additions, etc. that we
      made to the BON grammar here. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> The grammar is unclear as to the usage of list concatenators
        (e.g. "," in rules like Enumeration_list).  We believe this is due
        to the lack of clarity of the discussion of the ellipses
        meta-construct ("...") in the grammar specification.  We have
        written our grammar such that such concatenators are only used
        between two terms and not at the end of a term. <br />

      See bug <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=455621&group_id=33004&atid=407108">455621</a>
      for more details on this issue. </li>

      <li> Likewise, the grammar is unclear with respect to the use of final
      list terminators for constructs like Index_clause.  As stated in the
      discussion in bug <a
      href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=456406&group_id=33004&atid=407108">456406</a>,
      we believe that these final list terminators should be optional. Most
      of the text examples from the text follow this model. <br />

      The problem is that it is unclear what the intention of such
      terminators is; given the Eiffel influence on BON it would be
      surprising if any terminators were necessary at all. <br />
    </li>

    <li> While ellipses are used throughout the examples, no keyword or
        operator for such is specified in the grammar.  We added a
        ELLIPSES_TOKEN to deal with such. <br />

        In the original grammar this token is used only in the
        Indirection_list.  We have found it necessary to add it to the
        Static_component rule because it is used in this manner in the
        example specifications.  The new rule is
        <pre>
          Static_component: Cluster_rule
                  | Class_rule
                  | Static_relation
                  | ELLIPSES_TOKEN ;
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li> No provision is made for exceptional circumstances in BON (e.g.,
      exceptions, signals, etc.).  This should be part of the extension we
      are working on.
      </li>
    </ul>
